prettyprintlib
==============

A pretty printing library for ActionScript 3.0
that allows you to nicely print stuff in a console.

[Wikipedia Prettyprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint)
> Prettyprint (or pretty-print) is the application of any of various stylistic
formatting conventions to text files, such as source code, markup, and similar
kinds of content.

> These formatting conventions can adjust positioning and spacing (indent style),
add color and contrast (syntax highlighting), adjust size, and make similar
modifications intended to make the content easier for people to view, read,
and understand.

> Prettyprinters for programming language source code are sometimes called
code beautifiers or syntax highlighters.

Info
----

This library is alpha quality, I use it mainly for debugging stuff in colors
on the command-line with Redtamarin.
